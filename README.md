# VaniliaLemon | A Student House

<br />

## UX

The purpose of this project is to create a static 'digital framework' **(front-end only)** website that provides a basic information for new upcomming customers. The target audiences for this website are students seeking a private accomodation in Manchester.

<br />

**In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:**

* Details of what to expext from us
* A map showing where the accomodation is situated
* A gallery of images of our accomodation we offer for our potential customer
* A form where you can contact us with your name, email and your request
* A basic information for students included our basic policy and terms of conditions
* Social media links for users to follow to stay up to date with any news the band may have
