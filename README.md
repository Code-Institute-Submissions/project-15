**VaniliaLemon | A Student House**

<br />

**Milestone Project 1**

This is a 'digital framework' I have developed for my project. It is a front-end website that provides a basic information for students seeking a private accomodation in Manchester with:

1. Details of what to expext from us
2. A map showing where the accomodation is situated
3. A gallery of images of our accomodation we offer for our potential customer
4. A form to send
5. A basic information for students included our basic policy and terms of conditions

**DEMO** <br />

A demo of this site is available <a href="https://mirofrankovic.github.io/project-1/">here</a>

This app is hosted by GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service which supports client-side code. It does not support server-side code in languages like PHP or Python.

**GETTING STARTED / DEPLOYMENT** <br />

<li>If you wish to run this site locally, please clone or download this repo. You can then run index.html or open index.html in your browser.</li>
<li>If you wish to deploy a live version of this site, then you will need to create your own GitHub repo. Navigate to settings and enable GitHub Pages by setting the Source to master branch.

<li>This project uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">HTML5</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS3</a>programming languages</li>

<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">AWSCloud9</a> - this developer uses Cloud9 within an Ubuntu based workspace using a mobile firstapproach for their IDE while writting, running and debugging code</li>

<li><a href="https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/">BootstrapCDN</a></li>
