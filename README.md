![alt-text](https://github.com/mirofrankovic/project-1/blob/master/assets/img/snip-min.PNG "title image 1")

## UX

The purpose of this project is to create a static 'digital framework' **(front-end only)** website that provides a basic information for new upcomming customers. The target audiences for this website are students seeking a private accomodation in Manchester.

**In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:**

* Details of what to expext from us
* A map showing where the accomodation is situated
* A gallery of images of our accomodation we offer for our potential customer
* A form where you can contact us with your name, email and your request
* A basic information for students included our basic policy and terms of conditions
* Social media links for users to follow to stay up to date with any news the band may have

## DEMO

Git used for the Version control and [GitHub](https://github.com/) used as hosting service for Git Repositories of this site.

# TESTING 

* AUTOMATED TESTING
* VALIDATION SERVICES - validation services were used to ensure the the validity of the website code
1. [Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
2. [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Devices Used:

* Samsung Galaxy S8 – Android 8.0
* Samsung Galaxy S7 - Android 8.0
* Samsung Galaxy S6 – Android 7.0
* iPhone 6 – iOS 11.4
* Dell Laptop 15‑bs0xx - Windows 10
* iPad Air 2 – iOS 11.2.2 & iOS 11.4.1

### Browsers Used:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari

#### Manual testing was undertaken for this application and satisfactorily passed. A sample of the tests conducted are as follows:

* I have thoroughly tested this website and was unable to find any broken links within it. I have also tried to submit blank contact forms and forms with incorrect email addresses which gave me an error message on each field to show that the required attribute within my form is working as it should
* Testing the code to call the google API and the ability to scroll, zoom and click on map marker for location details
* Testing buttons and hyperlinks throughout the site
* Responsive Testing The app was tested on Samsung S8, Apple iPhone 6, Apple iPad Air 2 and also using the Google Chrome inspect  feature to tes for repsonsiveness and any errors that occurred. The main issue which was found was the navbar and rounded images not resizing

## Issues/Bugs

I had a major issue with a fixed background on iOS devices. I had images set up on my home page that were fixed when I scroll up and down and they looked good on every device except for iOS. It was like the image was zoomed in so far and stretched on both iPhones and iPads. I did a lot of research to try and fix this but to no avail. I found a couple of posts with suggestions for a fix, but it only worked for the whole background of the page and not just a section of the page.
Also, I had an issue with the size of my images. I used [Optimizilla](https://imagecompressor.com/) to resize my images for faster running my website and better responsivness for small devices.

# DEPLOYMENT

### The site was developed using the cloud9 IDE and uses git for version control and pushed to GitHub.
